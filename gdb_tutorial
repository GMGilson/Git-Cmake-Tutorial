Before running gdb compile the binary with -g or --gstabs to save symbol table and labels

$gdb ./{executable}
    {--tui} will display the source code of the executable
        in --tui mode gdb defaults to focusing the source code
            (gdb) focus {window} 
                will change the focus of gdb to the called window
                    possible windows
                        src: source code
                        cmd: gdb shell
                        asm: disassembly code
            (gdb) refresh 
                will refresh the windows incase --tui mode looks fucked up
            (gdb) update 
                will update source windows and the current execution point
        You can change the window height using 
            (gdb) winheight {window} {+ or -}count

    {--args} will accept arguments that would follow the executable to make run command easier

(gdb) r(shorthand) || run  
    will run the program and stop at first break point

(gdb) b(shorthand) || break {line number or label} 
    will set a breakpoint in the debugger

(gdb) p(shorthand){\t} || print {arg}
    will print the value at the {arg}
    {/t} denotes the format you want print to display its default is hex
        x:integer
        d:decimal
        u:unsigned
        o:octal
        t:binary
        c:ascii char
        f:floating point

    in assembly objects must by cstyle type casted to the format you want to see it in
    arrays can be display as:
        (gdb) p/u array[0]@10
        will print the array from index 0 to ten
    
    all print statements can be used with cstyle operators such as *(dereference), &(address_of)

(gdb) watch {expression}
    sets a watchpoint that will break when {expr} is changed

(gdb) tty {filename}
    set the default run configuration of the r command with stdin redirection of {filename}

(gdb) d(shorthand) || delete {optional index}
    without {index} will ask to delete all break points  
    with {index} will delete breakpoint at {index}

(gdb) disable/enable {index}
    will enable/disable breakpoint at {index}


(gdb) s(shorthand) ||step
    steps a line

(gdb) c(shorthand) || continue
    continues until next breakpoint

(gdb) u(shorthand) || until
    continues until stackframe is deleted

(gdb) i(shorthand) || info {arg}
    gives information of {arg} at curent state of program
    Possible {args}
        symbol {addr}: prints the symbol the addres is stored at
        register: prints all registers
        args: prints args of the selected frame
        local: prints local vars
        catch: print all exception handellers in current stack frame
        breakpoints: prints all breakpoints
        frame: verbose information of the current stack frame
        mem: table of defined memory regions
        


(gdb) set {label} = {value}
    sets {label} = {value}
    
    
(gdb) display {expression/label}
    will print out {expression/label} after every step of the program


(gdb) call {function or subroutine}(ARGS)
	will call the equivalent written in the executable
	cannot call functions that have not been compiled with the origional binary
		-> cannot call vec.pop_back() if the function was not called anywhere else in the program
		   this is because gdb is not a compiler and since that function was not called anywhere else in the program
		   it likely was never compiled in the first place


$(bash) ulimit -c unlimited
	enables the generation of core files upon segfault

	core files are saved states of your program that can be look at and altered like snapshots 

$(bash) gdb ${EXECUTABLE} ${COREFILE}
	loads the saved core state of the program in gdb

(gdb) set use-coredump-filter on|off
	applies the core snapshot to the current gdb session


(gdb) gcore ${FILENAME}
		produces a core file at the current state of the gdb session
