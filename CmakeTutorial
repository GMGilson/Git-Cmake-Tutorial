#Creating Lists in Cmake
	As the amount project files get larger or build trees diverge heavily it becomes impractical to just keeping adding filenames as agruments. This leads us to creating list variables that we can call to represent all the files we pass to it

	list(APPEND ${LISTNAME} "file1" "file2"...)
	
	The list name can be defined higher in the build tree, expanded, shortened, and called later in the build tree

#Setting a list variable for all source files in a directorya
	
	AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY({file} {VAR})
	
#I've had problems with AUX_SOURCE_DIRECTORY() before 
#Sometimes file(GLOB) works better
#does the same thing with better documentation
	file(GLOB ${VAR} "some unix wildcard expression")

#CMake Control Flow
	* as more files are added to the project we want to try to stay away from thigns that may repeat steps in the compilation process that we have already done
	* this leaves control flow something to be desired so we may find and skip certain compilation steps

	Cmake control flow goes as follows:
		if(${CMAKEVAR})
			${CMAKE Directives}...
		endif()
	Control flow bools can be augmented with logical keywords like {AND, NOT, OR,}
